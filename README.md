# RAG-Powered PDF Chat SaaS

## Overview

This project is a side project I developed to explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology and experiment with full-stack AI application development. It's a PDF Chat SaaS application that demonstrates the power of combining various cutting-edge technologies to create an intelligent document interaction system.

## What It Does

This application allows users to:

1. Upload PDF documents to the system.
2. Process and index the content of these documents using advanced AI techniques.
3. Engage in natural language conversations about the uploaded documents.
4. Receive intelligent responses based on the content of the documents.

The core functionality is powered by RAG, which enhances the AI's responses by retrieving relevant information from the uploaded documents. This results in more accurate and context-aware answers compared to traditional chatbots.

For example, a user could upload a complex scientific paper and then ask questions about specific sections, methodologies, or conclusions. The system would analyze the document, understand the context, and provide detailed, relevant answers based on the paper's content.

## Key Features

- Seamless PDF document upload and processing
- AI-powered chat interface for document-based conversations
- Vector-based document retrieval for enhanced accuracy and relevance
- User authentication and management for personalized experiences
- Subscription-based access with Stripe integration for potential monetization
- Responsive and clean user interface for ease of use across devices
